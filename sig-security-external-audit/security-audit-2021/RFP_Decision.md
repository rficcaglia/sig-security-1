# Third-Party Security Audit Subproject - RFP Decision Process

Kubernetes SIG Security's Third-Party Security Audit subproject (subproject, henceforth) runs the process of conducting a third-party security audit for the Kubernetes project.

The process started with publishing a Request for Proposal (RFP) in 2021 which outlined the scope and goals of the third-party security audit.
The RFP closed after receiving four (4) responses to the RFP.
The subproject leads evaluated the RFP responses to determine which vendor to proceed with the audit.
The subproject leads are experienced in the information security industry and are active contributors to the Kubernetes project.

Due to the extension of the RFP until four responses were received and contract negotiations, the 2021 Third-Party Security Audit will continue into 2022.

Similar to the 2019 Third-Party Audit RFP process, the RFP responses were evaluated and scored by the subproject leads on a scale of 1 to 5 on the following categories:

- Personnel fit and talent
- Relevant understanding and experience (orchestration systems, containers, hardening, etc.)
- The individual work products requested in the RFP:
  - Threat model
  - Report
  - Code analysis
  - Reference architecture

Based on the above criteria, the scores of the RFP responses were:

| Vendor | Total Score|
|--------|------------|
| Vendor A | 124 |
| Vendor B | 108 |
| Vendor C | 165 |
| Vendor D | 163 |

The Kubernetes SIG Security's Third-Party Security Audit subproject selects NCC Group to complete the 2021/2022 third-party security audit for the Kubernetes project.

We look forward to working with NCC Group on the audit and to partner with various SIGs on this assessment.
